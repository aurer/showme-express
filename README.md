# Showme

A service to show get and post variables in an easy to read page. 
Requests can be saved and 'Shared' temporarily.

## Bookmarklets

There are two bookmarklets in [/assets/dist/bookmarklets](https://github.com/aurer/showme-express/tree/master/assets/bookmarklets), to use them just copy the raw code into a bookmark, when you want to use it just click the bookmark.

1. **ShowMeGet** - This simply opens Showme with any request parameters you have in the url at the time.
2. **ShowMeForms** - This finds any forms on the page and alters the action so it submits to Showme, click again to revert the form back to it's original state.
